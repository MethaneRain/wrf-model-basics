Repo to document my journey into atmospheric modeling with WRF and related models

---

As my career in the atmospheric sciences has evolved, I've noticed that both my desire and my skillset have tended towards numerical modeling. Without a higher degree (Masters or PhD) I've been unable to gain experience and have not been qualified to pursue jobs that require model experience. 

So I made a decision that I wanted to build and compile the WRF model on my personal computer. Obviously I won't be able run super complex runs and I can't run multiple processors and/or nested domains. With that said, I still could gain the basics if I could get the WRF running.

I'm not a beginner when it comes to dealing with computers and programming, but I don't have any formal education or work experience either so this task was a little overwhelming at first but with the help of NCAR's (<a href=https://www2.mmm.ucar.edu/wrf/OnLineTutorial/compilation_tutorial.php>MMM compilation tutorial</a>) and numerous others online, I figured I could actually make this happen.

Luckily I had already had Fortran and C compilers up and running on my computer for working with Fortran scripts not too long ago, as well as having NetCDF installed which is fundamental for working with the WRF program. However, I still ran into some hurdles trying to make sure all the ```PATHS``` were pointing to the correct locations. More on that later...
