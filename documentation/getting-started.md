Welcome to my basic WRF model guide!

In this repo, I have several shell and python scripts that will automate running my WRF build based on GFS data input, which I will add other input data sources in the future.

---

The way my scripts and build are set up are for a very specific GFS model data input and is based closely on NCAR's MMM (<a href="https://www2.mmm.ucar.edu/wrf/OnLineTutorial/compilation_tutorial.php#STEP7">data grab</a>) in their tutorial.
